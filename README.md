# Parallel-Web-Crawler
Turning single-threaded into multi-threads to improve the performance of web crawler.

Upgrade the code to take advantage of multi-core architectures to increase crawler throughput.    Furthermore, measure the performance of crawler to prove that, given the same amount of time, the multi-threaded implementation can visit more web pages than the legacy implementation.
